# Rock-Paper-Scissors 

### Abstract:
<!-- This is a functional website where you can enter, and choose whether you want to see an affirmation or mantra that can be viewed if you click the "Receive Message" button to get a random affirmation and mantra from the website. Also if you choose to create your own mantra and affirmation, it is possible to do here! Click the "Add your Message" button to do that. Your entered affirmation or mantra will be added to the array of affirmation and mantras within the code. When going through the list, your messages will appear from the array list. Working on this project helped not only to gain experience using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Also, reading the affirmation and mantras helped me a great deal. It truly was God sent, considering the difficult time I am going through in my life right now. I am grateful for the opportunity and the inspiring affirmations and mantras that I've read many times during the project. -->

### Learning Goals:
<!-- [//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)

The goals of this project were to gain some experience using HTML, CSS, and Javascript all in coordination with each other. Also use HTML and CSS specifically to try and match a given comp with a bit of challage under "Choose your own Adventure" the opportunity to individualize the skills we build. -->

### Wins + Challenges:
<!-- [//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
Wins:
- I started this project more confident, and felt comfortable using HTML and then adding some CSS to it.
The big win for me is not to be nervous because I understand and more familiar with HTML, CSS and JS. At the same time I am only on the very beginning of my journey. Lots and Lots to learn which is exciting.

Challenges:
 - I would create some functionality, which would then affect some other part. So it was challenging work. Also in the beginning of the project I thought I will add functionality like favorite, deleteing files and editing messages. Wich didn’t workout this time. I will continue to work on improveing this app and practicing what I am learning.
I struggled with the CSS `flex` getting my elements the way I wanted them. I am still fuzzy on understanding which parts were controlling the boxes and which ones I need to style. I definitely will be practicing by using and learning CSS. -->
