### Context:
This project was built as the final Module 1 project at the Turing School of Software & Design. Students were provided with a project specification document, which detailed the required functionality. I used vanilla HTML, CSS, and functional programming in JavaScript to implement all required features. Student were also allowed to choose our own theme and images, which I have done for this project.

### Learning Goals:
<!-- [//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?) -->
- Solidify and demonstrate my understanding of DRY JavaScript and event delegation to handle similar event listeners.
- Understand the difference between the data model and how the data is displayed on the DOM
- Use my problem solving process to break down large problems, solve things step by step, and trust yourself to not rely 
  on an outside “answer” to a logical challenge

### Wins + Challenges:

Wins:
- This was the first project where we were given creative freedom to make the game board. I really enjoyed this process and found it extremely beneficial for my learning of CSS and HTML.
- More cunfident to get value from nested properties of an object.
- using the `debugger` to solve the issues of the broken code.

Challenges:
 - I struggled with the Git Hub this time around. I accidentally manage to initiate `git init` inside home directory. Eventhough I removed the hidden .git file I still was getting errors when I was trying to push my work. I didn't see a main branch for some reason. I definitely will be practicing and learning Git Hub to avoid mistakes in the future.
